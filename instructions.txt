- Each user uniquely identified by an ID, is associated with a unique username and a unique email address. Additional data about the customer, such as password, full name, phone number, address, user category (like 'regular', 'premium'), and a designated helpdesk email address.
- A customer may register one or more credit cards on the platform. Key details related to these credit cards, including the card number, its associated bank, and bank code are kept.
- There are numerous shops. Each store is identified by a unique shop ID and has a distinct name. Each shop sells different products. Every product has a name, colour, size, price, and description and may also have one or multiple photos. A product belongs to a certain product type identified by a product type id. A product type has a description, and all product types form a hierarchy - a product type may have one other product type as its parent. Some shops are restricted to sell a subset of types of products only.
- A customer can place an order. Each order is tracked by an order id and the date of the order as well as a status (‘processing’, ‘completed’ or ‘cancelled’) is maintained.
- An order may include one or more order items (products). For each order item (product), we keep the product unit price, the quantity of the product ordered as well as a status (‘processing’, ‘shipped’ or ‘out of stock’), and some other related information. Each order item may have a sequence number, which is unique within each order. Note that the order price can be different from the product price.
- An invoice is issued for every order. Each invoice carries an invoice number, a date and a status (‘issued’ or ‘paid’).
Payment can be made for an invoice. The payment id, date, amount, payment method (like 'credit card', 'paypal'), and transaction fee (based on payment method) are captured. 
- Shipment will be made for items in a fully-paid order. Shipment of items from an order can be made separately. The shipment id, items, date and tracking number are recorded for each shipment.
